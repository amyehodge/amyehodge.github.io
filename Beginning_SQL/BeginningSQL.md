# Hands-on Intro to SQL (Structured Query Language)

This workshop will teach the basics of working with and querying structured data in a database environment. This workshop uses the SQLite plugin for Firefox. We will provide laptops with the correct software for the workshop. If you bring your own machine to the workshop, you must have the software installed in advance.

## <a name="software"></a> Software and data setup

*If you are using one of the Library's laptops, skip this section.*

1. [Download Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and install it.
2. Download and install the SQLite Manager add on: **Menu (the three horizontal lines near the
top right corner of Firefox) -> Add-ons -> Search -> SQLite
Manager -> Install -> Restart now**
4. Add SQLite Manager to the menu: **Menu -> Customize, then drag the SQLite Manager icon to one of the empty menu squares on the right, Exit Customize**
3. Download the [Portal Database](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292171) as well as the individual csv files for [plots](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299474), [species](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483), and [surveys](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172).   
	* Note that in the .sqlite database file the surveys table has a field called `plot` that in the surveys.csv file is called `plot_id`. We will use the .sqlite file in the workshop. If you choose to import the individual .csv files and follow along with this lesson, you will need to adjust this field name in your queries.
5. Open SQLite Manager: **Menu -> SQLite Manager**

## <a name="dataset"></a> Dataset description

The data we will be using is a time-series for a small mammal community in
southern Arizona. This is part of a project studying the effects of rodents and
ants on the plant community that has been running for almost 40 years. The
rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots, with different experimental
manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.

This is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. We've
simplified it a little bit for the workshop, but you can download the
[full dataset](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/) and work with it using
exactly the same tools we'll learn about today.

> **CHALLENGE 1:**
Open each of the csv files and explore them. What information is contained in each file? What would you need to answer the following research questions? Which files have the data you would need? What operations would you need to perform if you were doing these analyses from these csv files?
> * How has the hindfoot length and weight of *Dipodomys* species changed over time?
> * What is the average weight of each species, per year?
> * What information can I learn about *Dipodomys* species in the 2000s, over time?

## <a name="import"></a> Import data into SQLite

We can import our data in one of two ways:  
1. Import the .sqlite database file  
2. Import the individual tables  

### Import the database file

1. Select **Database -> Connect Database**
2. Choose the portal_mammals.sqlite file

### Import the individual tables

1. Start a New Database by selecting **Database -> New Database**
2. Name your database and save it to the desktop
3. Import your data tables into your database by selecting **Database -> Import**
4. Click on the **Select File** and choose the surveys.csv file
5. Give the table a name (or use the default)
6. If the the file has column headings in the first row, check the appropriate box (our tables have column headings in the first row)
7. Make sure the delimiter and quotation options are correct (our tables use a comma delimiter and double quotes)

![Setting import options](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL1b.png "Setting import options")  

Click **OK**.

When asked if you want to modify the table, click **OK** and then set the data types for each column (field) as indicated below.

##### Data types for each column (field)

| Table | Column | Data Type |
| :------| :------| :------|
| surveys | record_id | integer |  
| surveys | month | integer |  
| surveys | day | integer |  
| surveys | year | 	integer	 |  
| surveys | plot_id | integer |  
| surveys | species_id | text |   
| surveys | sex | text |
| surveys | hindfoot_length | real |  
| surveys | weight | real |    


![Defining data types](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL2b.png "Defining data types")

Once the data has been imported, the panel on the left will display a list of the tables under the heading "Tables."

To see the contents of a table, click on that table and then click on the Browse
and search tab in the right hand section of the screen.

![Contents of species table](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL3b.png "Contents of species table")

---

> **CHALLENGE 2:**
Import the plots and surveys tables using the information provided in the table below.

---

| Table | Column | Data Type |
| :------|:------|:------|
| plots | plot_id |integer |
| plots | plot_type | text |  
| species | species_id | text |
| species | genus | text |  
| species | species | text | 	 
| species | taxa | text |    


You can also use this same approach to append new data to an existing table.

## <a name="design"></a>Relational databases and database design

* Relational databases store data in tables with fields (columns) and records (rows).
* The records are not in any particular order.
* Data fields have types and all values in a field have the same type ([list of data types](#datatypes)). We defined these data types when we imported our tables.
* Each table contains a single field (or combination of fields) that uniquely defines each database record. This field is called the primary key. We defined these as well when we imported our tables.
* Every row-column combination (cell) contains a single *atomic* value, i.e., not containing parts we might want to work with separately. Note how the genus and species information in the **species** table are in separate fields.


![Row-column combinations contain atomic values](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL4.png "Row-column combinations contain atomic value")


* Data are split into multiple tables, each containing one class of information.
* Tables are related by shared columns of information. The field of data in one table that correlates to the primary key field of another table is called the foreign key.
* Queries let us look up data or make calculations based on the fields of data.

![Visual representation of the schema for the database we will be working with.](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/mammalsDB_schema.png "Visual representation of the schema for the database we will be working with.")


## <a name="whyuse"></a> Why use relational databases

* Data separate from analysis.
  * There is no risk of accidentally changing data when analyzing it.
  * If we change the data we can rerun the query
* It's fast for large amounts of data.
* It improves quality control of data entry: it's possible to constrain types, which is especially easy if you use forms available in database programs like Access, Filemaker, etc.
* The concepts of relational database querying are core to understanding how to do similar things using programming languages such as R or Python.

## <a name="dbms"></a> Database management systems

There are a number of different database management systems for working with relational data. We're going to use SQLite today, but basically everything we teach you will apply to the other database systems as well (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS Access, Filemaker Pro). The differences between these are mostly in the details of exactly how to import and export data, the specific data types, and nuances of how the queries are written.


## <a name="basic"></a> Basic queries
To write a query, click on the Execute SQL tab from within any of your database tables.

![Execute SQL](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL5.png "Execute SQL")  

Letâ€™s write a SQL query that selects only the year column from the **surveys** table. Enter the query in the box labeled "Execute SQL."

    SELECT year FROM surveys;

This is called a "SELECT statement." We have capitalized the words `SELECT` and `FROM` because they are SQL keywords. SQL is case insensitive, but capitalizing helps with readability and is considered a best practice for SQL. In addition, every query must end in a semicolon. This is how the software knows this is the end of the query.

To run the query in SQLite, click on the RunSQL button that is underneath the text box. If you were doing this at a command-line interface, you would hit "enter."

![Run query](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL6.png "Run query")

If we want more information, we can add a new column to the list of fields that are listed immediately after `SELECT`.

    SELECT year, month, day FROM surveys;

Or we can select all of the columns in a table using the wildcard "``*``".

    SELECT * FROM surveys;

***CHALLENGE 1: Write a query that returns the year, month, day, species ID, and weight from the surveys table.***

### <a name="unique"></a> Unique values

If we want only the unique values so that we can quickly see what species have been sampled we use the keyword ``DISTINCT``.

    SELECT DISTINCT species_id FROM surveys;

If we select more than one column, then the distinct pairs of values are returned.

    SELECT DISTINCT year, species_id FROM surveys;

This is a good point to introduce another best practice for formatting SQL queries. It helps with readability if you separate the parts of the query onto separate lines. So the above query should be written:

    SELECT DISTINCT year, species_id
    FROM surveys;

### <a name="calculated"></a> Calculated values

We can also do calculations with the values in a query. For example, if we wanted to look at the mass of each individual on different dates, but we needed it in kg instead of g we could use this query:

    SELECT year, month, day, weight/1000
    FROM surveys;

When we run the query, the expression `weight/1000` is evaluated for each row and appended to that row, in a new column. Note that if we had used the integer data type for weight and divided by the integer 1000, the results would have been reported as integers. In order to get more significant digits, you would need to include the decimal point so that SQL knows you want the results reported as floating point numbers.

Expressions can use any fields, any arithmetic operators (+ - * /) and a variety of built-in functions (`MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `ROUND`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `LEN`, etc). For example, we could round the values to make them easier to read.

    SELECT plot, species_ID, sex, weight, ROUND(weight/1000, 2)
    FROM surveys;

## <a name="filtering"></a> Filtering

Databases can also filter data â€“ selecting only the data meeting certain criteria. For example, letâ€™s say we only want data for the species *[Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam%27s_kangaroo_rat)*, which has a species code of DM. We need to add a `WHERE` clause to our query:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE species_id="DM";

We can do the same thing with numbers. Here, we only want the data since 2000:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE year >= 2000;

We can use more sophisticated conditions by combining filters with AND as well as OR. For example, suppose we want the data on *Dipodomys merriami* starting in the year 2000:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year >= 2000) AND (species_id = "DM");

Note that the parentheses arenâ€™t needed in this case, but again, they help with readability. They also ensure that the computer combines `AND` and `OR` in the way that we intend. (`AND` takes precedence over `OR` and will be evaluated before `OR`.)

For example, if we wanted to get all the records from before 1980 or from 2000 or later that were about species DM and we might want to write the query this way:

	SELECT *
	FROM surveys
	WHERE year < 1980 OR year >=2000 AND species_id="DM";

However, the program will evaluate `AND` first and then `OR`, which would give us all records for DM from 2000 or later, combined with all records from before 1980 for any species. The correct way to write this query would be this:

	SELECT *
	FROM surveys
	WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >=2000) AND species_id="DM";

If we wanted to get data from these years for any of the *Dipodomys* species, which have species codes DM, DO, and DS, we could combine the conditions using `OR`:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >=2000) AND ((species_id = "DM") OR (species_id = "DO") OR (species_id = "DS"));

The above query is getting kind of long, so let's use a shortcut for all those `OR`s. This time, letâ€™s use `IN` as one way to make the query easier to understand. `IN` is equivalent to saying `WHERE (species_id = "DM") OR (species_id = "DO") OR (species_id = "DS")`, but reads more neatly:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys  
    WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS"));

We started with something simple, then added more clauses one by one, testing their effects as we went along. For complex queries, this is a good strategy to make sure you are getting what you want. It also might be helpful to create a subset of the data that you can easily see in a temporary database to practice your queries on before working on a larger or more complicated database.

***CHALLENGE 2: Update your query from Challenge 1 to include plot ID in the results, and include filters so that only individuals caught on plot 1 or plot 2 and that weigh more than 75g are returned.***

## <a name="missing"></a>Missing data

`NULL` can be used in queries to represent missing data (note that this is not the same as true or false or 0).

For example, to find all instances where the species_id was not entered, we can write this query:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE species_id IS NULL;     

Or to find all cases where a weight value was entered:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE weight IS NOT NULL;            

***CHALLENGE 3: Write a query to determine the average weight of the individuals in records 1, 63, and 64. How are null values treated?***

## <a name="sort"></a> Sorting

We can also sort the results of our queries by using `ORDER BY`. Let's keep going with the query we've been writing.

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS"))
    ORDER BY plot_id ASC;

The keyword `ASC` tells us to order it in ascending order. We could alternately use `DESC` to get descending order.

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS"))
    ORDER BY plot_id DESC;

`ASC` is the default, so you don't actually need to specify it, but it helps with clarity.

We can also sort on several fields at once. Let's do by plot and then by species.

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS"))
    ORDER BY plot_id ASC, species_id DESC;

***CHALLENGE 4: Update your query from Challenge 2 so that the results are ordered first by plot (ascending) and then lists the individuals in order from the biggest to the smallest.***

## <a name="order"></a>Order of execution vs. order of query

Another note for ordering. We donâ€™t actually have to display a column to sort by it. For example, letâ€™s say we want to order by the plot ID and species ID, but we only want to see the date, plot, and weight information.

    SELECT day, month, year, plot_id, weight
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS"))
    ORDER BY plot_id ASC, species_id DESC;

We can do this because sorting occurs earlier in the computational pipeline than field selection.

The computer is basically doing this:

1. Collecting data from tables according to `FROM`
2. Filtering rows according to `WHERE`
3. Sorting results according to `ORDER BY`
4. Displaying requested columns or expressions according to `SELECT`


When we write queries, SQL dictates the query parts be supplied in a particular order: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `JOIN...ON`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`. Note that this is not the same order in which the query is executed. (We'll get to `JOIN...ON` and `GROUP BY` in a bit.)


***CHALLENGE 5: Update your query from Challenge 4 so that weight is displayed in kilograms and rounded to two decimal places. Only display results for female animals captured in 1999. Order the results alphabetically by the species ID.***


## <a name="aggregation"></a> Aggregation

Aggregation allows us to combine results by grouping records based on value and to calculate combined values in groups.

Letâ€™s go to the **surveys** table and find out how many individuals there are. Using the wildcard counts the number of records (rows).

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys;

There are many other aggregate functions included in SQL including `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `AVG`. We can find out the average of weight for all of those individuals by using the function `AVG`.

    SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(weight)
    FROM surveys;

Something a little more useful might be finding the number and average weight of a particular species in our survey, like DM.

	SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(weight)
    FROM surveys
    WHERE species_id="DM";

Now let's output this value in kilograms, rounded to 3 decimal places.

    SELECT COUNT(*), ROUND(AVG(weight)/1000, 3)
    FROM surveys
    WHERE species_id="DM";

Now, let's see how many individuals were counted in each species. We do this using a `GROUP BY` clause.

    SELECT species_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id;

`GROUP BY` tells SQL what field or fields we want to use to aggregate the data. If we want to group by multiple fields, we give `GROUP BY` a comma separated list. Let's add in the year.

	SELECT species_id, year, COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id, year;

We can order the results of our aggregation by a specific column, including the aggregated column. Letâ€™s order by the count in descending order, so the ones with the highest count are at the top of the list.

	SELECT species_id, year, COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id, year
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

Let's modify this to show us the average weight for each species identified during each year, and how many total individuals there were for each of those species.

	SELECT species_id, year, COUNT(*), AVG(weight)
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id, year
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

And now let's make the output a little more readable:

	SELECT species_id AS 'Species ID',
		year AS 'Year',
		COUNT(*) AS 'Total Individuals',
		AVG(weight) AS 'Average weight (g)'
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id, year
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

***CHALLENGE 6: Write a query to determine how many of each sex were counted in each species. Ignore the records with no sex indicated. Then, expanding on this query, list the weight of the largest animal in each category. Ignore the records that do not have weight indicated. What species ID is the largest female and how much does she weigh?***

## <a name="joins"></a> Joins

To combine data from two tables we use the SQL `JOIN` command, which comes after the `FROM` command.

We will also need to use the keyword `ON` to tell the computer which columns provide the link ([Primary Key > Foreign Key](#design)) between the two tables. In this case, the species_id column in the **species** table is defined as the primary key. It contains the same data as the **survey** table's species_id column, which is the foreign key in this case.  We want to join the tables on these species_id fields.

    SELECT surveys.species_id AS 'Species ID',
		year AS 'Year',
		COUNT(*) AS 'Total Individuals',
		AVG(weight) AS 'Average weight (g)'
    FROM surveys
    JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id
    GROUP BY surveys.species_id, year
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

`ON` is kind of like `WHERE`, in that it filters things out according to a test condition. We use the table.colname format to tell the software what column in which table we are referring to.

Field names that are identical in both tables can confuse the software so you must specify which table you are talking about, any time you mention these fields. You do this by inserting the table name in front of the field name as *table.colname*, as I have done above in the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` parts of the query.

And if you get tired of typing all those table names over and over, you can define an abbreviation for them by simply typing it immediately following the table names in the `FROM` and `JOIN` parts of the statements. Note that you can use the abbreviation in the `SELECT` part of the statement even though you don't define it until after that. (Why do you think that is? Hint: see the section above on the order of operations.)

    SELECT u.species_id AS 'Species ID',
		year AS 'Year',
		COUNT(*) AS 'Total Individuals',
		AVG(weight) AS 'Average weight (g)'
    FROM surveys u
    JOIN species p ON u.species_id = p.species_id
    GROUP BY u.species_id, year
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

***CHALLENGE 7: Write a query that returns the genus, the species, and the weight of every individual captured at the site.***

You can also combine many tables using a join. The query must include enough `JOIN`...`ON` clauses to link all of the tables together. In the query below, we are now looking at the count of each species for each type of plot during each year. This required 1) adding in an extra `JOIN`...`ON` clause, 2) including plot_type in the `SELECT` portion of the statement, and 3) adding plot_type to the `GROUP BY` function:

    SELECT u.species_id AS 'Species ID',
		year AS 'Year',
		plot_type AS 'Plot Type',
		COUNT(*) AS 'Total Individuals',
		AVG(weight) AS 'Average weight (g)'
    FROM surveys u
    JOIN species p ON u.species_id = p.species_id
    JOIN plots o ON o.plot_id = u.plot_id
    GROUP BY u.species_id, year, plot_type
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

***CHALLENGE 8: Expand the query above to include the plot type and average weights (rounded to two decimal places) for each species/plot type combination. Order the output from the lowest weight to the highest. Exclude all records that don't have weight values recorded. Optional: use table name abbreviations and make the output easier to read.***

## <a name="sets"></a> Set operators

The set operators `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` can be used to compare the results from two `SELECT` statements. Note that the fields selected in the two queries must be identical in order for this to work.

    A UNION B will return all the distinct rows present to A & B
    A UNION ALL B will return all the rows present to A & B, including repetitions
    A INTERSECT B will return all the rows common to A & B
    A EXCEPT B will return all the rows present in A but not present in B

To use a set operator, write the two queries and combine them with the operator. For example, this query will identify all the individuals that weight over 50g and that were female. Note that you could more easily and elegantly write this query without the set operator; this is only for example purposes.

    SELECT species_id, plot, sex, weight
    FROM surveys
    WHERE sex='F'
    INTERSECT
    SELECT species_id, plot, sex, weight
    FROM surveys
    WHERE weight>225;

***CHALLENGE 9: Write a query using a set operator to identify all the species (by genus, species, and species_id) found in 1977 but not in 2002.***

### <a name="query"></a> SQL query  

This is an actual query used in an analysis of Twitter data. The goal of the research was to "validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking tool" to measure public perceptions in emergencies. In this case they were looking specifically at swine flu. This query is also available in a [text file](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/twitter_query.txt). See the source listed below the query for all the SQL queries used in this research (note how their non-standard formatting is really hard to read!).  

See if you can understand how this query works, even without the database tables. We covered all of this in our lesson!

## <a name="comment"></a> Commenting your queries

It is good practice to include comments in your queries so that you remember the purpose of the query and other people can understand it's purpose, and to describe what various parts of the query are doing or why they were included.  

Comments are ignored by the software and can be added in one of two ways.  

Short comments can be added by including them after two consecutive dashes. A line return signals the end of the comment. In the query below, the comment "-- only data from plots 1 & 2" in the 7th line will be ignored.

    SELECT p.genus,
    	p.species,  
		COUNT(*) AS 'Total individuals',
		AVG(u.weight) AS 'Average weight (g)'
	FROM surveys u
    JOIN species p ON u.species_id=p.species_id
	WHERE (u.plot=1 OR u.plot=2) AND (u.weight > 75) -- only data from plots 1 & 2
	GROUP BY p.species_id
	ORDER BY p.species_id;

Longer comments can be added and separated from the query text by enclosing them in a forward slash and asterisk combination (`/*...*/`), as shown below. These comments can be written on multiple lines and the final asterisk-forward slash combination signals the end of the comment.  

    SELECT p.genus,
    	p.species,
    	COUNT(*) AS 'Total individuals',
    AVG(u.weight) AS 'Average weight (g)'
    FROM surveys u
    JOIN species p ON u.species_id=p.species_id
    WHERE (u.plot=1 OR u.plot=2) AND (u.weight > 75)
    GROUP BY p.species_id
    /* I am grouping the results by species_id because I want to see the average weights and
    total numbers separated out for the individual species*/
    ORDER BY p.species_id;

Details about commenting code can be found in the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_comment.html).


## <a name="exportsave"></a> Exporting & saving query results

* Export Results:  To export your results into a saved file on your computer, click on the button next to **Actions** and choose **Save Result to File**. This file is not queriable.
* Save Results: To save your results as a special kind of table called a view, click on **View** in the main menu and choose **Create View**. You can view and query this special table in SQLite.


## <a name="saving"></a> Saving queries in SQLite Manager

It is possible to save queries within the SQLite Manager so that you can run them again later. The program creates a table where the queries are stored. Here are the steps for doing this.

Start by selecting **Tools > Use Table for Extension Data**

![Enabling query saving](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/save1.png "Enabling query saving")  

This creates a table in your database called **__sm_ext_mgmt** and adds new options above and below the **Enter SQL** box in the **Execute SQL** tab.

![New query options](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/save2.png "New query options")  

The buttons above the box allow you to scroll forward and backward through your saved queries, to save the current query in the **Enter SQL** box, and to delete the history of the queries that you have run (this does not delete the queries). Below the box is a drop-down menu that lets you choose a saved query to run.

To save a query, first enter the query in the box.

![Enter query](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/save3.png "Enter query")  

Click on the symbol of the disk (next to the trash can) to save the query. Enter a name for the query in the pop-up box and click **OK**.

![Enter query name](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/save4.png "Enter query name")

The query is now saved!

When you want to run the query again, select the query from the **Select a Query** drop-down box.

![Select a query](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/save5.png "Select a query")

The query will appear in the **Enter SQL** box and can be edited before running if desired. Editing the query here will not change the saved query.

To delete a query, run the following statement from the **Enter SQL** box, replacing "query_name" with the name of your query.

    DELETE FROM __sm_ext_mgmt WHERE type="NamedQuery:query_name"



## <a name="command"></a> Running sqlite3 from the command line

The SQLite Manager plug in we have been using for this lesson is a convenient interface for working with a database. However, you might want to store and edit queries in a file, or be able to automatically direct your output to a file. These are tasks are much simpler when run from the command line.

SQLite3 can be run directly from the command line. Detailed information about how to do this is available at [sqlite.org](http://sqlite.org/cli.html).

In order to do this you need to be in the shell (Terminal window on Mac), and you need to be in the directory where your .sqlite database file resides. Then just type `sqlite3` followed by the name of the .sqlite databases file and you are instantly in the sql interface, ready to type in a query.

Type `.help` at the prompt to see options available, or check out the more detailed explanation of most of your choices at the sqlite.org link above.   
Type `.tables` to see a list of all your database tables.    
Type any `SELECT` statement directly from the prompt. Be sure to end with a semicolon and hit `Return` to run the query.  
Run a query from a .sql file (your query saved as a text document with a .sql file extension) by typing `.read` followed by a space and the file name.  
Type `.mode csv` to change the standard output to .csv format (instead of delimited by pipes).    
Type `.once` followed by a space and a file name to send the output from the next `.read` query to a file instead of to the screen.  
Type `.exit` to leave sqlite.
