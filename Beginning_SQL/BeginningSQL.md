# Hands-on Intro to SQL (Structured Query Language)

This workshop will teach the basics of working with and querying structured data in a database environment. This workshop uses the SQLite plugin for Firefox. We will provide laptops with the correct software for the workshop. If you bring your own machine to the workshop, you must have the software installed in advance.

## <a name="dataset"></a> Dataset description

The data we will be using is a time-series for a small mammal community in
southern Arizona. This is part of a project studying the effects of rodents and
ants on the plant community that has been running for almost 40 years. The
rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots, with different experimental
manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.

This is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. We've
simplified it a little bit for the workshop, but you can download the
[full dataset](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/) and work with it using
exactly the same tools we'll learn about today.

> #### CHALLENGE 1
> Open each of the csv files and explore them. What information is contained in each file? If you had the following research questions:
> * How has the hindfoot length and weight of *Dipodomys* species changed over time?
> * What is the average weight of each species, per year?
> * What information can I learn about *Dipodomys* species in the 2000s, over time?
What would you need to answer these questions? Which files have the data you would need? What operations would you need to perform if you were doing these analyses from these csv files?

## <a name="import"></a> Import data into SQLite

We can import our data in one of two ways:  
1. Import the .sqlite database file  
2. Import the individual tables  

### Import the .sqlite database file

1. Select **Database -> Connect Database**
2. Choose the portal_mammals.sqlite file

### Import the individual tables

1. Start a New Database by selecting **Database -> New Database**
2. Name your database and save it to the desktop
3. Import your data tables into your database by selecting **Database -> Import**
4. Click on the **Select File** and choose the surveys.csv file
5. Give the table a name (or use the default)
6. If the the file has column headings in the first row, check the appropriate box (our tables have column headings in the first row)
7. Make sure the delimiter and quotation options are correct (our tables use a comma delimiter and double quotes)

![Setting import options](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL1b.png "Setting import options")  

Click **OK**.

When asked if you want to modify the table, click **OK** and then set the data types for each column (field) as indicated below.

##### Data types for each column (field)

| Table | Column | Data Type |
| :------| :------| :------|
| surveys | record_id | integer |  
| surveys | month | integer |  
| surveys | day | integer |  
| surveys | year | 	integer	 |  
| surveys | plot_id | integer |  
| surveys | species_id | text |   
| surveys | sex | text |
| surveys | hindfoot_length | real |  
| surveys | weight | real |    


![Defining data types](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL2b.png "Defining data types")

Once the data has been imported, the panel on the left will display a list of the tables under the heading "Tables."

To see the contents of a table, click on that table and then click on the Browse
and search tab in the right hand section of the screen.

![Contents of species table](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL3b.png "Contents of species table")

> #### CHALLENGE 2
> Import the plots and surveys tables using the information provided in the table below.


| Table | Column | Data Type |
| :------|:------|:------|
| plots | plot_id |integer |
| plots | plot_type | text |  
| species | species_id | text |
| species | genus | text |  
| species | species | text | 	 
| species | taxa | text |    


You can also use this same approach to append new data to an existing table.

## <a name="design"></a>Relational databases and database design

* Relational databases store data in tables with fields (columns) and records (rows).
* The records are not in any particular order.
* Data fields have types and all values in a field have the same type ([list of data types](#datatypes)). We defined these data types when we imported our tables.
* Each table contains a single field (or combination of fields) that uniquely defines each database record. This field is called the primary key. We defined these as well when we imported our tables.
* Every row-column combination (cell) contains a single *atomic* value, i.e., not containing parts we might want to work with separately. Note how the genus and species information in the **species** table are in separate fields.


![Row-column combinations contain atomic values](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL4.png "Row-column combinations contain atomic value")


* Data are split into multiple tables, each containing one class of information.
* Tables are related by shared columns of information. The field of data in one table that correlates to the primary key field of another table is called the foreign key.
* Queries let us look up data or make calculations based on the fields of data.

![Visual representation of the schema for the database we will be working with.](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/mammalsDB_schema.png "Visual representation of the schema for the database we will be working with.")


## <a name="whyuse"></a> Why use relational databases

* Data separate from analysis.
  * There is no risk of accidentally changing data when analyzing it.
  * If we change the data we can rerun the query
* It's fast for large amounts of data.
* It improves quality control of data entry: it's possible to constrain types, which is especially easy if you use forms available in database programs like Access, Filemaker, etc.
* The concepts of relational database querying are core to understanding how to do similar things using programming languages such as R or Python.

## <a name="dbms"></a> Database management systems

There are a number of different database management systems for working with relational data. We're going to use SQLite today, but basically everything we teach you will apply to the other database systems as well (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS Access, Filemaker Pro). The differences between these are mostly in the details of exactly how to import and export data, the specific data types, and nuances of how the queries are written.


## <a name="basic"></a> Basic queries
To write a query, click on the Execute SQL tab from within any of your database tables.

![Execute SQL](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL5.png "Execute SQL")  

Letâ€™s write a SQL query that selects only the year column from the **surveys** table. Enter the query in the box labeled "Execute SQL."

    SELECT year FROM surveys;

We have capitalized the words `SELECT` and `FROM` because they are SQL keywords. SQL is case insensitive, but capitalizing helps with readability and is good style for SQL. When running queries from the command line or a script file, the queries must end in a semicolon. This is how the software knows this is the end of the query. It's good practice to get in the habit of doing this, even though this interface does not require it.

To run the query in SQLite, click on the RunSQL button that is underneath the text box. Alternatively, `Cmd` + `;` will also run the query.

![Run query](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/BSQL6.png "Run query")

If we want more information, we can add a new column to the list of fields, right after `SELECT`.

    SELECT year, month, day FROM surveys;

Or we can select all of the columns in a table using the wildcard "``*``".

    SELECT * FROM surveys;

> #### CHALLENGE 3
> Identify the species ID and weight for each survey item and the date on which it was recorded.

### <a name="unique"></a> Unique values

If we want only the unique values so that we can quickly see what species have been sampled we use the keyword ``DISTINCT``.

    SELECT DISTINCT species_id FROM surveys;

If we select more than one column, then the distinct pairs of values are returned.

    SELECT DISTINCT year, species_id FROM surveys;

This is a good point to introduce another good style practice for SQL queries. It helps with readability if you separate the parts of the query onto separate lines. So, the above query is better written as:

    SELECT DISTINCT year, species_id
    FROM surveys;

### <a name="calculated"></a> Calculated values

We can also do calculations with the values in a query. For example, if we wanted to look at the mass of each individual on different dates, but we needed it in kg instead of g we could use this query:

    SELECT year, month, day, weight/1000
    FROM surveys;

When we run the query, the expression `weight/1000` is evaluated for each row and appended to that row, in a new column. Note that if we had used the integer data type for weight and divided by the integer 1000, the results would have been reported as integers. In order to get more significant digits, you would need to include the decimal point (i.e. 1000.0) so that SQL knows you want the results reported as floating point numbers.

Expressions can use any fields, any arithmetic operators (+ - * /) and a variety of built-in functions (`MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `ROUND`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `LEN`, etc). For example, we could round the values to make them easier to read.

    SELECT plot, species_ID, sex, weight, ROUND(weight/1000, 2)
    FROM surveys;

> #### CHALLENGE 4
> Identify the species ID and weight in milligrams for each survey item and the date on which it was recorded.

## <a name="filtering"></a> Filtering

Databases can also filter data â€“ selecting only the data meeting certain criteria. For example, letâ€™s say we only want data for the species *Dipodomys merriami*, which has a species code of DM. We need to add a `WHERE` clause to our query:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE species_id="DM";

We can do the same thing with numbers. Here, we only want the data since 2000:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE year >= 2000;

We can use more sophisticated conditions by combining filters with AND as well as OR. For example, suppose we want the data on *Dipodomys merriami* starting in the year 2000, we can combine those filters using `AND`.

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year >= 2000) AND (species_id = "DM");

Note that the parentheses arenâ€™t needed in this case, but they help with readability.

If we wanted get data for any of the *Dipodomys* species, which have species IDs of DM, DO, and DS, we can combine those using `OR`.

		SELECT *
		FROM surveys
		WHERE (species_id = "DM") OR (species_id = "DO") OR (species_id = "DS");

The above query is getting kind of long, so let's use a shortcut for all those `OR`s. This time, letâ€™s use `IN` as one way to make the query easier to understand. `IN` is equivalent to saying `WHERE (species_id = "DM") OR (species_id = "DO") OR (species_id = "DS")`, but reads more neatly:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys  
    WHERE species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS");

> #### CHALLENGE 5
> Produce a table listing the data for all individuals in Plot 1 that weighed more than 75 grams, telling us the date, species ID, and weight (in kg).

Continuing with the evaluation of `AND` and `OR`, if we wanted to get all the records from before 1980 or from 2000 or later that were about species DM, we might be inclined to write the query this way:

	SELECT *
	FROM surveys
	WHERE year < 1980 OR year >=2000 AND species_id="DM";

However, because `AND` takes logical precendence over `OR`, the program will evaluate `AND` first and then `OR`, which would give us all records for DM from 2000 or later, combined with all records from before 1980 for any species. The correct way to write this query would be this:

	SELECT *
	FROM surveys
	WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >=2000) AND species_id="DM";

The parentheses ensure that the computer combines `AND` and `OR` in the way that we intend.

We started with something simple, then added more clauses one by one, testing their effects as we went along. For complex queries, this is a good strategy to make sure you are getting what you want. It also might be helpful to create a subset of the data that you can easily see in a temporary database to practice your queries on before working on a larger or more complicated database.

> #### CHALLENGE 6
> Identify the species ID, weight, and plot ID for each survey item, and include filters so that only individuals caught on plot 1 or plot 2 and that weigh more than 75g are included.

## <a name="missing"></a>Missing data

`NULL` can be used in queries to represent missing data (note that `NULL` is not the same as 0).

For example, to find all instances where the species_id was not entered, we can write this query:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE species_id IS NULL;     

Or to find all cases where a weight value was entered:

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE weight IS NOT NULL;            

> #### CHALLENGE 7
> Write a query to determine the average weight of the individuals in records 1, 63, and 64. How are null values treated?

## <a name="sort"></a> Sorting

We can also sort the results of our queries by using `ORDER BY`. Let's keep going with the query we've been writing.

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS"))
    ORDER BY plot_id ASC;

The keyword `ASC` tells us to order it in ascending order. We could alternately use `DESC` to get descending order.

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS"))
    ORDER BY plot_id DESC;

`ASC` is the default, so you don't actually need to specify it, but it helps with clarity.

We can also sort on several fields at once. Let's do by plot and then by species.

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE (year < 1980 OR year >= 2000) AND (species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS"))
    ORDER BY plot_id ASC, species_id DESC;

> #### CHALLENGE 8
> Alphabetize the species table by genus and then species.

## <a name="order"></a>Order of execution vs. order of query

We donâ€™t actually have to display a column in our query output in order to use it for sorting that output. For example, letâ€™s say we want to order by the plot ID and species ID, but we only want to see the date, plot, and weight information.

    SELECT day, month, year, plot_id, weight
    FROM surveys
    WHERE year < 1980 AND species_id IN ("DM", "DO", "DS")
    ORDER BY plot_id ASC, species_id DESC;

We can do this because sorting occurs earlier in the computational pipeline than field selection.

The computer is basically doing this:

1. Collecting data from tables according to `FROM`
2. Filtering rows according to `WHERE`
3. Sorting results according to `ORDER BY`
4. Displaying requested columns or expressions according to `SELECT`

When we write queries, SQL dictates the query parts be supplied in a particular order: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `JOIN...ON`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`. Note that this is not the same order in which the query is executed. (We'll get to `JOIN...ON` and `GROUP BY` in a bit.)

## <a name="aggregation"></a> Aggregation

Aggregation allows us to combine results by grouping records based on value and to calculate combined values in groups.

Letâ€™s go to the **surveys** table and find out how many individuals there are. Using the wildcard counts the number of records (rows).

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys;

There are many other aggregate functions included in SQL including `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `AVG`. We can find out the average of weight for all of those individuals by using the function `AVG`.

    SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(weight)
    FROM surveys;

Something a little more useful might be finding the number and average weight of a particular species in our survey, like DM.

		SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(weight)
    FROM surveys
    WHERE species_id="DM";

> #### CHALLENGE 9
> Calculate the total, average, minimum, and maximum weights of the animals collected over the duration of the survey, then see if you can calculate these values only for animals that weighed between 5 and 10 g.

Now, let's see how many individuals were counted in each species. We do this using a `GROUP BY` clause.

    SELECT species_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id;

`GROUP BY` tells SQL what field or fields we want to use to aggregate the data. If we want to group by multiple fields, we give `GROUP BY` a comma separated list.

> #### CHALLENGE 10
> * Identify how many animals were counted in each year total.
> * Identify how many animals were counted in each year per species.
> * Identify the average weight of each species in each year.
> * Now try to combine the above queries to list how many and the average weight for each species in each year.

We saw earlier that `WHERE` allows us to filter results according to some criteria. We can filter results based on aggregate functions as well, using the keyword `HAVING`.

For example, we can adapt the last query we wrote to only return information about species with a count higher than 10:

		SELECT species_id, COUNT(*)
		FROM surveys
		GROUP BY species_id
		HAVING COUNT(*)>10;

> #### CHALLENGE 11
> Figure out how many different genera (that's the plural of genus!) there are in each taxa, but only for cases where there are 10 or more genera. List the taxa with the most genera at the top.

## <a name="joins"></a> Joins

To combine data from two tables we use the SQL `JOIN` command, which comes after the `FROM` command.

We will also need to use the keyword `ON` to tell the computer which columns provide the link ([Primary Key > Foreign Key](#design)) between the two tables. In this case, the species_id column in the **species** table is defined as the primary key. It contains the same data as the **survey** table's species_id column, which is the foreign key in this case.  We want to join the tables on these species_id fields.

		SELECT *
		FROM surveys
		JOIN species
		ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id

`ON` is kind of like `WHERE`, in that it filters things out according to a test condition. We use the `table.colname` format to tell the software what column in which table we are referring to.

Field names that are identical in both tables can confuse the software so you must specify which table you are talking about, any time you mention these fields. You do this by inserting the table name in front of the field name as `table.colname`, as I have done above in the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` parts of the query.

We often won't want all of the fields from both tables, so anywhere we would have used a field name in a query on a single table, we can use `table.colname` in our join.

For example, what if we wanted information on when individuals of each species were captured, but instead of their species ID, we wanted their actual species names.

		SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, species.species
		FROM surveys
		JOIN species
		ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;

> #### CHALLENGE 12
> Identify the genus, species, and weight of every individual captured at the site.


We can count the number of records returned by our original `JOIN` query.

		SELECT COUNT(\*)
		FROM surveys
		JOIN species
		ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id

Notice that this number is smaller than the number of records present in the survey data.

This is because, by default, SQL only returns records where the joining value is present in the join columns of both tables (i.e. it takes the intersection of the two join columns). This joining behavior is known as an `INNER JOIN` (this term can be used interchangeably with `JOIN`).

We can also tell the computer that we wish to keep all the records in the first table by using the command `LEFT OUTER JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN` for short.

> #### CHALLENGE 13
> Rewrite the join above to keep all the entries present in the `surveys` table. How many records are returned by this query?

Joins can also be combined with sorting, filtering, and aggregation. So, if we wanted average mass of the individuals on each different type of treatment, we could do something liek

		SELECT plots.plot_type, AVG(survey.weight)
		FROM surveys
		JOIN plots
		ON surveys.plot_id = plots.plot_id
		GROUP BY plots.plot_type;

> #### CHALLENGE 14
> How many of each genus were caught in each plot? Report the answer with the greatest number at the top of the list.

You can also combine many tables using a join. The query must include enough `JOIN`...`ON` clauses to link all of the tables together. In the query below, we are now looking at the count of each species for each type of plot during each year. This required 1) adding in an extra `JOIN`...`ON` clause, 2) including plot_type in the `SELECT` portion of the statement, and 3) adding plot_type to the `GROUP BY` function:

    SELECT surveys.species_id, surveys.year, plots.plot_type, COUNT(*), surveys.AVG(weight)
    FROM surveys
    JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id
    JOIN plots ON plots.plot_id = surveys.plot_id
    GROUP BY surveys.species_id, year, plot_type
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

> #### CHALLENGE 15
> Expand the query above to include the plot type and average weights (rounded to two decimal places) for each species/plot type combination. Order the output from the lowest weight to the highest. Exclude all records that don't have weight values recorded. Optional: use table name abbreviations and make the output easier to read.***

## <a name="comment"></a> Commenting your queries

It is good practice to include comments in your queries so that you remember the purpose of the query and other people can understand it's purpose, and to describe what various parts of the query are doing or why they were included.  

Comments are ignored by the software and can be added in one of two ways.  

Short comments can be added by including them after two consecutive dashes. A line return signals the end of the comment. In the query below, the comment "-- only data from plots 1 & 2" in the 7th line will be ignored. These comments can also included on separate lines.

    SELECT p.genus,
    	p.species,  
		COUNT(*) AS 'Total individuals',
		AVG(u.weight) AS 'Average weight (g)'
	FROM surveys u
    JOIN species p ON u.species_id=p.species_id
	WHERE (u.plot=1 OR u.plot=2) AND (u.weight > 75) -- only data from plots 1 & 2
	GROUP BY p.species_id
	ORDER BY p.species_id;

Longer comments can be added and separated from the query text by enclosing them in a forward slash and asterisk combination (`/*...*/`), as shown below. These comments can be written on multiple lines and the final asterisk-forward slash combination signals the end of the comment.  

    SELECT p.genus,
    	p.species,
    	COUNT(*) AS 'Total individuals',
    AVG(u.weight) AS 'Average weight (g)'
    FROM surveys u
    JOIN species p ON u.species_id=p.species_id
    WHERE (u.plot=1 OR u.plot=2) AND (u.weight > 75)
    GROUP BY p.species_id
    /* I am grouping the results by species_id because I want to see
		average weights and
    total numbers
		separated out for the individual species*/
    ORDER BY p.species_id;

Details about commenting code can be found in the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_comment.html).


## <a name="exportsave"></a> Exporting & saving query results

* Export Results:  To export your results into a saved file on your computer, click on the button next to **Actions** and choose **Save Result to File**. This file is not queriable.
* Save Results: To save your results as a special kind of table called a view, click on **View** in the main menu and choose **Create View**. You can view and query this special table in SQLite.


## <a name="saving"></a> Saving queries in SQLite Manager

It is possible to save queries within the SQLite Manager so that you can run them again later. The program creates a table where the queries are stored. Here are the steps for doing this.

Start by selecting **Tools > Use Table for Extension Data**

This creates a table in your database called **__sm_ext_mgmt** and adds new options above and below the **Enter SQL** box in the **Execute SQL** tab.

![New query options](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/save2.png "New query options")  

The buttons above the box allow you to scroll forward and backward through your saved queries, to save the current query in the **Enter SQL** box, and to delete the history of the queries that you have run (this does not delete the queries). Below the box is a drop-down menu that lets you choose a saved query to run.

To save a query, first enter the query in the box.

![Enter query](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/save3.png "Enter query")  

Click on the symbol of the disk (next to the trash can) to save the query. Enter a name for the query in the pop-up box and click **OK**.

![Enter query name](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/save4.png "Enter query name")

The query is now saved!

When you want to run the query again, select the query from the **Select a Query** drop-down box.

![Select a query](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/images/save5.png "Select a query")

The query will appear in the **Enter SQL** box and can be edited before running if desired. Editing the query here will not change the saved query.

To delete a query, run the following statement from the **Enter SQL** box, replacing "query_name" with the name of your query.

    DELETE FROM __sm_ext_mgmt WHERE type="NamedQuery:query_name"



## <a name="command"></a> Running sqlite3 from the command line

The SQLite Manager plug in we have been using for this lesson is a convenient interface for working with a database. However, you might want to store and edit queries in a file, or be able to automatically direct your output to a file. These are tasks are much simpler when run from the command line.

SQLite3 can be run directly from the command line. Detailed information about how to do this is available at [sqlite.org](http://sqlite.org/cli.html).

In order to do this you need to be in the shell (Terminal window on Mac), and you need to be in the directory where your .sqlite database file resides. Then just type `sqlite3` followed by the name of the .sqlite databases file and you are instantly in the sql interface, ready to type in a query.

Type `.help` at the prompt to see options available, or check out the more detailed explanation of most of your choices at the sqlite.org link above.   
Type `.tables` to see a list of all your database tables.    
Type any `SELECT` statement directly from the prompt. Be sure to end with a semicolon. That's how the computer knows you are at the end of the query. Hit `Enter` or `Return` after the semicolon to run the query.  
Run a query from a .sql file (your query saved as a text document with a .sql file extension) by typing `.read` followed by a space and the file name.  
Type `.mode csv` to change the standard output to .csv format (instead of delimited by pipes).    
Type `.once` followed by a space and a file name to send the output from the next `.read` query to a file instead of to the screen.  
Type `.exit` to leave sqlite.

### <a name="schema"></a> Database schema

The image below is an example of a database schema for an actual database - CyBase. [Cybase](http://www.cybase.org.au/) is a database of cyclic proteins that contains information about proteins, structures, and assays.

### <a name="query"></a> SQL query  

This is an actual query used in an analysis of Twitter data. The goal of the research was to "validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking tool" to measure public perceptions in emergencies. In this case they were looking specifically at swine flu. This query is also available in a [text file](http://amyehodge.github.io/Beginning_SQL/twitter_query.txt). See the source listed below the query for all the SQL queries used in this research (note how their non-standard formatting is really hard to read!).  

See if you can understand how this query works, even without the database tables. We covered all of this in our lesson!

	SELECT   
		DISTINCT T.title, T.tweetid, T.id, T.publishdate, T.link, T.content, T.updatedate, T.authorname, T.authoruri, W.webcite_id, W.long_url,  
		COUNT( T.title ) AS number_hits   
	FROM tweets T   
	LEFT JOIN webcite W ON T.tweetid = W.tweetid   
	WHERE   
		publishdate BETWEEN "2009-05-01 00:00:00" AND "2009- 12-31 23:59:59"   
		AND   
 		((LOWER(`title`) LIKE "%swine flu%" OR LOWER(`title`) LIKE "%swineflu%" OR LOWER(`title`) LIKE "%h1n1%"))   
 		AND   
 		((LOWER(`title`) NOT LIKE "%rt @%"   
 		AND   
 		LOWER(`title`) NOT LIKE "%rt@%"))   
 		AND   
 		((LOWER(title) LIKE "%http://%") OR (LOWER(title) LIKE "%https://%"))   
 	GROUP by title   
 	ORDER BY publishdate ASC;
