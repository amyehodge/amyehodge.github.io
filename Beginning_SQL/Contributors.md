## Contributors

This lesson is based on a SQL lesson published and taught by Data Carpentry. The original materials were adapted from Software Carpentry SQL lessons for ecologists by
Ethan White, which were adapted from Greg Wilson's original SQL lessons. 

The first Data Carpentry workshop was run at NESCent on May 8-9, 2014 with the development and instruction of lessons by Karen Cranston, Hilmar Lapp, Tracy Teal and Ethan White and contributions from Deb Paul and Mike Smorul.

These materials have been further modified by Amy Hodge for use in workshops at Stanford University.
